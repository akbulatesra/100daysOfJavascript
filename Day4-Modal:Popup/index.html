          In this world, everything can be happy. I really believe that if you
          practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush.
          If you hypnotize it, it will go away. We have all at one time or
          another mixed some mud. Automatically, all of these beautiful,
          beautiful things will happen. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're
          not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. It's a super
          day, so why not make a beautiful sky?
